# Download-File-Sorter
\download directory file sorter

This code is designed to sort files from \downloads category to \Desktop\Chest_sorter
folder can be downloaded in the git files named "Chest_sorter"

File paths can be changed to fit your needs in main.py 
Code comments marked with "#" will pin point where the paths are located.

You can cange dyrectory from where the files are sorted and where they end up. However, you can also use my direct configuration. 

To set up: You'll need to go to main.py and check the absolute PATHS to match with directories on your PC. Varuable that likely need changing is /user/**username**
